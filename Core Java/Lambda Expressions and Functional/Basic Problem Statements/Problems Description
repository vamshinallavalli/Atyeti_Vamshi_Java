ðŸ”¸ Problem 1: Filter Even Numbers
Objective: Use a Predicate<Integer> to filter even numbers from a list.

Instructions:

Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.

Use a lambda expression with a Predicate to check if a number is even.

Print only even numbers using stream().filter(...).

ðŸ”¸ Problem 2: String Uppercase Formatter
Objective: Use a Function<String, String> to convert strings to uppercase.

Instructions:

Create a list of strings like ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].

Use a lambda with Function<String, String> to convert each to uppercase.

Print the transformed list.

ðŸ”¸ Problem 3: Print Custom Greetings
Objective: Use a Consumer<String> to print a greeting message.

Instructions:

Create a lambda that takes a name and prints "Hello, [name]!".

Call the lambda for names like "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie".

ðŸ”¸ Problem 4: Generate Random Numbers
Objective: Use a Supplier<Integer> to generate random numbers.

Instructions:
