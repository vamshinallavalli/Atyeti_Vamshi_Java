Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java:

Library Management System:

Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
Description: Create a system to manage a library's book inventory. Include classes for Book, Member, and Librarian. Implement inheritance for different types of books (e.g., EBook, PrintedBook). Use polymorphism to handle different borrowing rules for members.
Online Shopping Cart:

Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Interfaces
Description: Develop an online shopping cart system. Include classes for Product, Cart, and Order. Implement interfaces for payment methods (e.g., CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment). Use encapsulation to protect the cart's contents.
Employee Management System:

Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstract Classes
Description: Create a system to manage employee records. Include classes for Employee, Manager, and Engineer. Use inheritance to extend Employee for different roles. Implement abstract classes to define common behaviors.
Banking System:

Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Exception Handling
Description: Develop a banking system with classes for Account, Customer, and Transaction. Implement inheritance for different account types (e.g., SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount). Use polymorphism for transaction processing and exception handling for error scenarios.
School Management System:

Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Collections
Description: Create a system to manage school operations. Include classes for Student, Teacher, and Course. Implement inheritance for different types of courses (e.g., OnlineCourse, OnsiteCourse). Use collections to manage lists of students and courses.
