Goal: Understand what your system needs to do.

Ask yourself:

What should the system manage? (Books, Members, Borrowing, Returning, etc.)

Who are the users? (Librarian, Member)

What actions can each user perform?

Letâ€™s assume:

Librarian can add/remove books, register members.

Member can borrow and return books.

Books can be of different types: EBook, PrintedBook.



Step by Step Process:-

Step 1: Define the Base Classes

Book Class:

Fields: title, author, ISBN, available
Methods: borrow(), returnBook(), getTitle(), getAuthor(), getISBN(), isAvailable(), setAvailable(boolean available)
Member Class:

Fields: name, memberId
Methods: borrowBook(Book book), returnBook(Book book), getName(), getMemberId()
Librarian Class:

Fields: name, employeeId
Methods: addBook(Book book), removeBook(Book book), getName(), getEmployeeId()
Step 2: Implement Inheritance for Different Types of Books
EBook Class (inherits from Book):

Fields: fileSize, format
Methods: getFileSize(), getFormat()
PrintedBook Class (inherits from Book):

Fields: numberOfPages, coverType
Methods: getNumberOfPages(), getCoverType()
Step 3: Use Polymorphism to Handle Different Borrowing Rules
Override borrow() Method in EBook and PrintedBook:
Methods: borrow()
Step 4: Encapsulate Data
Ensure all fields are private and provide public getters and setters for accessing and modifying the fields.
Step 5: Test the System
Main Class:
Methods: main(String[] args)
