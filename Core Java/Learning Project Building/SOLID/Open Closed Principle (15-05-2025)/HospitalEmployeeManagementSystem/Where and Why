where exactly implements open for execution and closed for modification?

Let‚Äôs pinpoint exactly where your code implements the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

üîÅ Open for Extension
Your code is open for extension in the following way:

You can add new device types (new classes) without changing existing code.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class SmartLight implements RemoteControl {
    @Override
    public void turningOn() {
        System.out.println("SmartLight Turning On");
    }

    @Override
    public void turningOff() {
        System.out.println("SmartLight Turning Off");
    }
}
You extend the behavior by adding SmartLight, and everything still works.

Then, in Person.java, you just do:

java
Copy
Edit
DeviceController light = new DeviceController(new SmartLight());
light.execute();
No need to modify RemoteControl, Tv, Projector, SurroundSoundSystem, or DeviceController.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs extension without modification.

‚ùå Closed for Modification
Your existing code does not need to be modified when:

You add a new device

You want different behavior (as long as it's encapsulated in a new class)

For example, DeviceController works without knowing the exact type of device:

java
Copy
Edit
public class DeviceController {
    private RemoteControl remoteControl;

    public DeviceController(RemoteControl remoteControl) {
        this.remoteControl = remoteControl;
    }

    public void execute() {
        remoteControl.turningOn();
        remoteControl.turningOff();
    }
}
This class never changes regardless of how many RemoteControl implementations you create.

That‚Äôs exactly what closed for modification means:
üö´ Don‚Äôt change existing code ‚Üí ‚úÖ Just add new classes
