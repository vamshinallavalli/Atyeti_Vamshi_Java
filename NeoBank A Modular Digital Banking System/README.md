# 🚀 NeoBank – Modular Digital Banking System

A highly scalable, modular, and production-ready digital banking platform built with **Java 17+**, **Spring Boot 3+**, and **Microservices Architecture**. NeoBank demonstrates core banking functionalities such as user authentication, account management, fund transfers, loan handling, and notifications. Each service is independently deployable and built using **SOLID principles** and established **design patterns**.

## 🔍 Overview

**NeoBank** is a cloud-ready digital banking system designed for extensibility, performance, and ease of maintenance. It follows a **microservice-based architecture**, ensuring each domain (user, account, transactions, loans, notifications) operates as an independent and loosely coupled module.

Each service:

- Is independently deployable  
- Maintains its own database schema (per service)  
- Exposes RESTful APIs  
- Can scale independently based on load

### Optional Components:
- **Eureka Server** – Service discovery  
- **Config Server** – Centralized configuration management

## 🔧 Microservices

### 1. **User Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- User registration & login  
- JWT-based authentication  
- Role-based authorization  

**Entities**: `User`, `Role`  
**Design Patterns**: Factory (role creation), Singleton (JWT utility)  
**SOLID**: SRP for `AuthService`, `UserService`

---

### 2. **Account Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- Account creation & linking to user  
- Balance management  

**Entities**: `Account`, `AccountType`  
**Design Patterns**: Builder, Repository

---

### 3. **Transaction Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- Fund transfers (NEFT, IMPS, RTGS)  
- Transaction logs  
- Mini statements  

**Entities**: `Transaction`, `TransactionType`  
**Design Pattern**: Strategy (transaction type handling)

---

### 4. **Loan Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- Loan application processing  
- Approval/rejection  
- EMI calculation  

**Entities**: `Loan`, `EMI`, `LoanType`  
**Design Patterns**: Chain of Responsibility (loan approval), Decorator (insurance)

---

### 5. **Notification Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- Email/SMS notifications  
- Alerting on transactions or updates  

**Entities**: `Notification`, `NotificationType`  
**Design Pattern**: Observer (event-driven communication)

---

### 6. **Gateway Service**
**Responsibilities**:
- Centralized entry point for all requests  
- Request routing & token validation  

**Tools**: Spring Cloud Gateway, Netflix Eureka

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Java 17+  
- Maven  
- MySQL  
- Docker (optional)

---

### 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeoBank.git
cd NeoBank
```

---

### 🔧 Configure MySQL

Each microservice uses its own MySQL database:

| Service              | Database Name             |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| User Service         | `user_service_db`         |
| Account Service      | `account_service_db`      |
| Transaction Service  | `transaction_service_db`  |
| Loan Service         | `loan_service_db`         |
| Notification Service | `notification_service_db` |

Update the respective `application.yml` or `application.properties` in each service.

---

### 🛠️ Build All Services

```bash
mvn clean install
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### 1. Run Services Individually

```bash
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Repeat for each service.

---

### 2. Run with Docker (Optional)

#### Build Docker Images:

```bash
docker build -t user-service ./user-service
docker build -t account-service ./account-service
docker build -t transaction-service ./transaction-service
```

#### Run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
