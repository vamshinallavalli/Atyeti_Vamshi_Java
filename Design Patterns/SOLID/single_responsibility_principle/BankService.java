  /*tommorow this class might enhance for study loan or gold loan or send otp as other third party api or need chnages in printing logic
    so if we change this 3-4 implemnetion in sam class it is not following single responsibiltiy principle then the solution is make a class with single responsibilties means their own implemnetation
    example loanService for loan realted responsibilities printter service for the print responsibilities lets create this classses */
